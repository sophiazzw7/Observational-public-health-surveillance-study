 Investigation on amphetamines

MRO’s assessment of the P-P plots for ET2, ET3, and ET7 supports the developer’s conclusions. For ET2, the empirical curve aligns closely with the model median through the central portion of the distribution, with small deviations in the extreme tails where quarterly counts are sparse. These deviations are common in operational risk frequency modeling because both unusually high-count quarters and very low event counts occur infrequently and are informed by a limited number of observations. Despite the Negative Binomial distribution’s ability to address overdispersion, finite-sample variability in these sparsely populated regions can cause the empirical distribution to diverge slightly from the model-implied curve. Given that the core distribution is well captured and the tail differences are symmetric and confined to data-sparse percentiles, MRO views the observed deviations as expected sampling noise rather than evidence of model misspecification.
 ## Introduction
Central nervous system stimulants, such as amphetamines, have seen widespreaduse over the past century, for legal and illegal purposes. A substantial portion of am-phetamine transactions are carried out in the "black market", hence it is important tostudy their spatial and temporal trends, both for public health and law enforcementpurposes. This repo investigated factors that affect the price (per mg) ofthe drug amphetamines based on a dataset taken from the website StreetRx.com. They gathers user-submitted information on street prices of diverted prescription or illicitdrugs.
## Data
The dataset for amphetamines consists of 76065 observations with 13 variables. I removed entries with NA values (58 rows), and splitted the date variable into year and month. The variables api_temp, form_temp and country has only one level for am-phetamines and hence are discarded. The variable city has about 8000 levels, which is not relevant/interesting without further geographicinformation linking them to states and regions, hence it is removed .For certain levels within the variables source, state and year, the number of entries aretoo small (<10) to be studied in a satisfactory manner, hence i also drop those levels. Since the distribution of ppm is extremely positively skewed, it is necessary to remove outliers that are three standard deviations away from the mean after normalization (this correspondsto a 99.7 percent interval) and performed a log-transformation on the value of ppm. The cleaned dataset consists of 75207 observations with 11 columns: both the origi-nal and log-transformed ppm(Price per mg), state, country, USA_region, source, mgstr,bulk_purchase, Primary_Reason, month and year.
