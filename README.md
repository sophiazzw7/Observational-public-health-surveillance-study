 Investigation on amphetamines

MRO’s assessment of the P-P plots for ET2, ET3, and ET7 supports the developer’s conclusions. For ET2, the empirical curve aligns closely with the model median through the central portion of the distribution, with small deviations in the upper tail where quarterly counts are sparse.

These tail deviations are expected in operational risk frequency modeling because the extreme upper tail is informed by very few observations, and unusually high-count quarters occur infrequently. As noted in published research, operational loss event processes often exhibit overdispersion and occasional high-activity periods, creating natural instability in the highest percentiles even when overall model fit is reasonable.

Given the limited number of tail observations and the symmetric, non-directional nature of the deviations, MRO views the ET2 tail differences as arising from finite-sample variability rather than evidence of structural misspecification.
 ## Introduction
Central nervous system stimulants, such as amphetamines, have seen widespreaduse over the past century, for legal and illegal purposes. A substantial portion of am-phetamine transactions are carried out in the "black market", hence it is important tostudy their spatial and temporal trends, both for public health and law enforcementpurposes. This repo investigated factors that affect the price (per mg) ofthe drug amphetamines based on a dataset taken from the website StreetRx.com. They gathers user-submitted information on street prices of diverted prescription or illicitdrugs.
## Data
The dataset for amphetamines consists of 76065 observations with 13 variables. I removed entries with NA values (58 rows), and splitted the date variable into year and month. The variables api_temp, form_temp and country has only one level for am-phetamines and hence are discarded. The variable city has about 8000 levels, which is not relevant/interesting without further geographicinformation linking them to states and regions, hence it is removed .For certain levels within the variables source, state and year, the number of entries aretoo small (<10) to be studied in a satisfactory manner, hence i also drop those levels. Since the distribution of ppm is extremely positively skewed, it is necessary to remove outliers that are three standard deviations away from the mean after normalization (this correspondsto a 99.7 percent interval) and performed a log-transformation on the value of ppm. The cleaned dataset consists of 75207 observations with 11 columns: both the origi-nal and log-transformed ppm(Price per mg), state, country, USA_region, source, mgstr,bulk_purchase, Primary_Reason, month and year.
