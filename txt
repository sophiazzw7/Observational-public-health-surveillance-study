erformance assessment focuses on population stability, discrimination, and rank-ordering behavior based on observed OGM results since the last validation.

From a purely metric-based perspective, independent of any thresholds, the model demonstrates stable and acceptable performance characteristics. Population stability remains strong across reporting periods, with PSI values consistently around 0.03–0.04, indicating no meaningful shift in the score distribution. Discrimination metrics indicate that the model continues to separate default and non-default populations. In 4Q2024, Somers’ D is 50.56 percent, which reflects moderate discriminatory power rather than an absence of signal. Supporting diagnostics, including ROC and KS curves and gains tables, show preserved rank ordering. The gains table exhibits a generally monotonic relationship between score bands and observed bad rates, with no material reversals, indicating that higher-risk accounts continue to be ranked ahead of lower-risk accounts.

In 2Q2025, discrimination metrics improve relative to 4Q2024. Somers’ D increases to approximately 69 percent, and the KS statistic is reported at 56 percent, indicating stronger separation between default and non-default populations. Review of the KS curve shows that the maximum separation occurs around the mid-score range, which aligns with the gains table showing concentration of observed bads in the lower score ranges and declining bad rates as scores increase. Taken together, these results indicate acceptable and improving rank-ordering performance over time, independent of any threshold framework.

When evaluated relative to monitoring thresholds, performance conclusions differ by period. Under the thresholds in effect during 4Q2024, both Somers’ D and accuracy metrics breached established criteria, resulting in a performance flag under the OGM framework. Following this period, the model developer revised the OGM thresholds and evaluated subsequent results against the updated criteria. Under the revised thresholds, the 2Q2025 performance metrics fall within acceptable ranges, and the developer concludes that the model is performing as intended.

From an MRO perspective, the underlying performance metrics support the conclusion that the model’s discriminatory behavior and rank ordering are acceptable and improving. However, MRO notes that performance conclusions in 2Q2025 are contingent on the revised threshold framework. While the developer has provided qualitative rationale for updating the thresholds, supporting quantitative analysis demonstrating why the revised thresholds are appropriate given observed bad-rate behavior and portfolio characteristics across recent OGM periods has not been provided.

Accordingly, MRO requests that the model developer provide documented analytical support for the threshold updates, including evaluation of historical bad-rate distributions, score-level performance, and performance stability across recent OGM periods, to ensure that the revised thresholds are appropriately justified and governed.
