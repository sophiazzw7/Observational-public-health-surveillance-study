In addition, for the upstream and downstream models listed in the MDD, we would like to confirm the linkage reflected for AA0019. As a reference point, we plan to share examples from another CCAR model, as our general assumption is that upstream and downstream linkages are largely consistent across CCAR models.Separately, we have a documentation update request for the MDD. In Table 1 (Upstream Models, EUCs, and Non-Models), could you please update the table to explicitly label which items are models versus non-models/EUCs?
