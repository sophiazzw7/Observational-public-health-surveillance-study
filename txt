Understood — I will **only lightly refine the wording**, keep your meaning exactly the same, and not restructure the substance.

Below is your write-up with clearer, more professional phrasing.

---

### a) Threshold Update and Monitoring

* Please clarify why the threshold was updated (including changes to the SoM and parameter adjustments).
* LGL and Recovery monitoring were expected to be added; however, Tables 9.5 currently only reflect total DFR thresholds. Please confirm whether separate thresholds for LGL and Recovery will be incorporated.
* The EWI appears to have been modified — please confirm whether it will be reverted or updated accordingly.

---

### b) Recovery Timing Monitoring

Monitoring was not added as a formal metric + threshold, and instead assessed for reasonableness.

It was noted that:

* 63.8% of recoveries (count-based) occur within 8 quarters of default; and
* 77.6% of recovery balances occur within 8 quarters of default.

The original question was whether 8 quarters is appropriate for the recovery timing assumption.

Please confirm:

* Whether this assumption will be periodically reassessed, even if not implemented as a formal monitoring metric.
* Whether supporting data and calculations for the 63.8% and 77.6% figures can be provided.

---

### c) Scaling Factor (CCAR)

It is stated in the MDD that:

* For CCAR, only the 9th quarter shows a consistent difference across periods, and a scaling factor of 1.98 is applied.
* The scaling factor is set to 1 for all other quarters.
* For CECL, differences are considered small and the scaling factor is set to 1.

Please provide:

1. The detailed calculation supporting the 1.98 scaling factor (including the underlying numbers and methodology).
2. The data supporting the ratio of true actual lifetime NCO to truncated lifetime NCO at each quarter.
3. Confirmation of the backtesting window used and alignment with Section 9.1.2.1.
4. The supporting data for Steps 1–5 referenced in the documentation.

---

### d) Monitoring of Retained Variables (dpd_90_flag and STI_pre_merger)

These variables were retained due to statistical significance and baseline anchoring effects.

Please confirm:

* Whether these variables will be monitored in their final model input form (including transformations).
* Whether PSI monitoring will be incorporated for these inputs, as referenced in Section 6.2 of the MDD.

If you'd like, I can also tighten this further to make it more concise and sharper for audit documentation.
