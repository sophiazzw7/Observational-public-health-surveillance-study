If he says: “Tell me about yourself.”

I’ve been on the team about four years now. Before that, I worked on developing machine learning models in medical research. My background is in statistics.

Since joining here, I’ve mostly worked on ML-related validations and some of the more technical models. I’ve also led a few Python-related projects and helped run internal trainings for the team.

Simple. Clear. Done.

2️⃣ If he asks: “What are you currently working on?”

Right now I’m working on DFR, some Bankcard validations, and Operational Risk models. I also cover the LightStream ML PD model.

A lot of my time lately has been around remediation follow-ups and making sure documentation and testing are tight.

Stable. Responsible.

3️⃣ If he asks: “What do you enjoy working on?”

I enjoy the more technical models, especially machine learning ones. I like digging into the modeling logic and testing assumptions.

I also enjoy building tools in Python to make validation more efficient.

Shows depth without bragging.

4️⃣ If you want to lightly signal growth interest

Over time, I’d like to take on more complex or high-impact models, especially on the ML side. I’m happy to step up where needed.

Not aggressive. Just forward-looking.

5️⃣ If he asks about team involvement

I’ve helped with some Python trainings and shared code templates with the team. I enjoy that part — helping others get more comfortable with the technical side.

Signals leadership without saying “I’m a leader.”

6️⃣ If he asks: “How’s workload?”

Safe answer:

It’s been busy but manageable. A couple of full scopes at the same time, but things are progressing.

Never say overwhelmed in first meeting.

7️⃣ If you want to connect to his AI move

Given your move into AI, I’d definitely be interested in contributing more on the ML side if there’s an opportunity.

Light. Strategic.
