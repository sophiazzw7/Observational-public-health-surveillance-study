The AA model is a downstream model designed to generate adverse action reason codes for the upstream MOD13512 credit risk model. Because MOD13512 is developed using a non-linear, tree-based XGBoost algorithm, a post-hoc explainability framework is required to support regulatory-compliant explanations.

The methodology consists of two core components: an explainability module and a reference group–based feature attribution framework. The explainability module is based on Shapley value theory and implemented using the SHAP framework, with TreeSHAP selected due to its computational efficiency and suitability for tree-based models. To address scalability when using large reference populations, a Monte Carlo–based simulation approach is applied to estimate feature contributions while maintaining numerical stability.
