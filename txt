Hi Alex,

As discussed last Friday, we need your assistance with sub-issue MIS0001218, bullet A.

The data dictionary provided by DAO indicates that the tfc_loan_closing_dt field should not be used. However, in code02_data_checks.sas, tfc_loan_closing_dt was used to join the Manheim table to create the original Manheim variables. Remove the statement from the Data Dictionary.

For this item, the developer team noted that this issue was previously discussed during validation. As mentioned before, the MD team does not own or produce the Data Dictionary, so they are not able to fulfill this request directly.

Could you please coordinate with the developer team and advise on remediation for this bullet?

Best regards,
Sophia
