Subject: AA0019 – Request for OGM Codes and Data (2025Q1–Q3)

Hi Sophie,

I hope you’re doing well. MRO is working on the Annual Review for AA0019.

Could you please help drop the OGM codes and data for 2025Q1–2025Q3 to the following location:
/sasdata/mrmrg1/dev_drop/?

If you do not have access to the mrmrg1 folder, please place the files in a read-only folder within the dev location and share the corresponding AD group.

Thank you in advance.

Best,
Sophia

In addition, we noted that the OGM data sources and controls table (Table 17 in the MDD) still reflects TBD for the portfolio data. Could you please let us know the current status of the PAD dataset and update the data control table accordingly (e.g., data source, ownership, controls, and references), if available?
