Hi [Name],

Hope you’re doing well.

I’m sharing the attached questions related to the DFR LGD remediation updates. Most of them focus on thresholds, recovery timing, scaling factor methodology, and monitoring of retained variables.

Whenever you get a chance, could you please take a look and let us know your thoughts? Happy to discuss live if that’s easier.
