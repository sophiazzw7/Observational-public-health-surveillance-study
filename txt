I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief status update and check in on scope as we move toward the Feb 27 deadline. Given the remaining timeline and the depth of analysis and code review required, I wanted to ask whether it might be possible to get some support on the remaining DFR items (Items 7–9). I can fully own the RAC work and cover the overlapping DFR components (OGM and assumptions), and additional support on the remaining DFR work would help ensure everything is completed at the expected level of rigor by the deadline.
