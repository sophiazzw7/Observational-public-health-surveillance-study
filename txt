The AH4950 Small Business Bankcard Account Management Model uses the Equifax Business Delinquency Financial Score (BDFS) to support small business bankcard account management. The model applies to the Small Business Bankcard portfolio. It predicts the likelihood that an existing account will become 90 or more days past due, including charge-offs and bankruptcies, within a 12-month performance window. As of March 2025, the model covers approximately $982 million in small business bankcard account balances.


Below is the **revised Model Performance Assessment section**, with your requested observations **integrated cleanly and concisely**, maintaining an MRO assessment tone and avoiding inference.

Model Performance Assessment

Performance assessment focuses on population stability, discrimination, and rank-ordering behavior based on observed OGM results since the last validation.

From a purely metric-based perspective, independent of any thresholds, the model demonstrates stable and acceptable performance characteristics. Population stability remains strong across reporting periods, with PSI values consistently around 0.03–0.04, indicating no meaningful shift in the score distribution. Discrimination metrics indicate that the model continues to separate default and non-default populations. In 4Q2024, Somers’ D is 50.56 percent, which reflects moderate discriminatory power rather than an absence of signal. Supporting diagnostics, including ROC and KS curves and gains tables, show preserved rank ordering. The gains table exhibits a generally monotonic relationship between score bands and observed bad rates, with no material reversals, indicating that higher-risk accounts continue to be ranked ahead of lower-risk accounts.

In 2Q2025, discrimination metrics improve relative to 4Q2024. Somers’ D increases to approximately 69 percent, and the KS statistic is reported at 56 percent, indicating stronger separation between default and non-default populations. Review of the KS curve shows that the maximum separation occurs around the mid-score range, which aligns with the gains table showing concentration of observed bads in the lower score ranges and declining bad rates as scores increase. Taken together, these results indicate acceptable and improving rank-ordering performance over time, independent of any threshold framework.

When evaluated relative to monitoring thresholds, performance conclusions differ by period. Under the thresholds in effect during 4Q2024, both Somers’ D and accuracy metrics breached established criteria, resulting in a “not performing as intended” assessment under the OGM framework. Following this period, the model developer revised the OGM thresholds and evaluated subsequent results against the updated criteria. Under the revised thresholds, the 2Q2025 performance metrics fall within acceptable ranges, and the developer concludes that the model is performing as intended.

From an MRO perspective, while recent metrics indicate stable and improving discriminatory behavior, the model was developed in 2015 and has exhibited a pattern of mixed performance assessments over recent OGM cycles, including “performing with caution” in 4Q2022 and 4Q2023 and “not performing as intended” in 4Q2024. Given the model’s age and repeated performance flags, MRO concludes that redevelopment is warranted.

MRO discussions with the model developer confirm that the model is expected to be redeveloped in 2026. However, a detailed redevelopment timeline and implementation plan have not been provided. Accordingly, MRO has raised a sub-issue requesting formal documentation of the redevelopment plan, including scope, milestones, and interim controls. In addition, MRO continues to request supporting quantitative analysis for the revised OGM thresholds to ensure that threshold changes are appropriately justified and governed.

Review Conclusion

Based on the Model Performance Assessment, ongoing monitoring results, and model history, MRO concludes that the model requires redevelopment. The model was developed in 2015 and has exhibited mixed performance outcomes across recent OGM cycles, including “performing with caution” in 4Q2022 and 4Q2023 and “not performing as intended” in 4Q2024. While recent OGM results show improvement in discrimination metrics under updated thresholds, the model’s age and repeated performance flags indicate that continued threshold adjustments are not a sufficient long-term solution.

MRO discussions with the model developer confirm that the model is expected to be redeveloped in 2026. However, a detailed redevelopment timeline, scope, and implementation plan have not been provided. Accordingly, MRO has raised a sub-issue requesting formal documentation of the redevelopment plan, including key milestones and interim governance considerations.

MRO’s review of OGM data quality concludes that the data are fit for model use. Model assumptions and limitations are adequately documented, and compensating controls are in place. These factors support continued interim use of the model under enhanced monitoring until redevelopment is completed.
