Here is a **more polite and formal version**, suitable for an immigration or corporate visa team:

Hi [Visa Team / Name],

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to kindly inquire whether it would be possible to share the PERM case number for my application, which was filed in September 2024. I would like to keep it for my personal records.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. Please let me know if there is any additional information you need from me.

Best regards,
Phoebe Chen

If you want it even softer (e.g., “whenever convenient”) or more concise, I can fine-tune it.
