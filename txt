xSubject: Follow-up Questions on DFR LGD Remediation

Hi [Name],

I hope you are doing well.

Please see the attached questions regarding the DFR LGD remediation updates. These primarily relate to threshold changes, recovery timing assumptions, scaling factor methodology, and monitoring of retained variables.

When you have a chance, we would appreciate your clarification and any supporting data referenced in the documentation.

Please let me know if it would be easier to discuss live.

Thank you,
Phoebe
