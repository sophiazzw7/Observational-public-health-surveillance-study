Stability Assessment

Stability was assessed using the Population Stability Index (PSI) in accordance with the OGM plan.

For 4Q2024, the reported PSI is 0.033, which is below the inner threshold of 0.10, indicating stable score distributions relative to the development baseline. The accompanying distribution plots show close alignment between the baseline and current score distributions.

For 2Q2025, the PSI remains low at approximately 0.04, continuing to fall below the 0.10 threshold. PSI results are consistent across reporting periods.

Based on these results, population stability is assessed as satisfactory, and changes in back-testing results are not attributable to population instability.

Back-Testing Assessment

Reported Results by Period

4Q2024

Back-testing results from 4Q2024 show:

Somers’ D of 50.56 percent.

Accuracy (MAD) of 1.15, exceeding the original accuracy threshold.

The model developer states that a Somers’ D of 50.56 percent represents moderate discrimination rather than low discriminatory power. The developer further notes that the original OGM thresholds were derived from a 2015 hBBT sample, where observed bad rates were very limited and reflect a risk environment that differs materially from more recent periods.

MRO agrees that the 4Q2024 Somers’ D level reflects moderate discrimination based on independent review of the accompanying diagnostics. The gains table for the 2023 vintage shows a generally monotonic pattern in observed bad rates across score bands, indicating preserved rank ordering despite the metric breach under the original threshold framework. No material bad-rate reversals are observed.

However, while the developer cites differences between the 2015 hBBT environment and recent portfolio behavior, no quantitative analysis is provided in the OGM materials to explicitly demonstrate how changes in bad-rate levels or portfolio composition justify the original threshold being no longer appropriate.

2Q2025 (Evaluated Against Updated Thresholds)

For 2Q2025, model performance is evaluated against updated OGM thresholds established by the model developer:

Somers’ D of approximately 69 percent.

KS statistic of 56 percent.

Gains table showing no bad-rate reversals.

Relative to 4Q2024, discrimination metrics improve materially in 2Q2025.

---

Joint Interpretation and KS / Gains Table Evidence

The KS statistic measures the maximum separation between the cumulative default and non-default distributions. Review of the 2Q2025 KS graph shows that the maximum separation occurs at approximately the 500 score level.

This observation is consistent with the 2Q2025 gains table, which shows that:

The majority of observed bads occur in the lower score range, approximately 101–518.

Bad rates decline as scores increase beyond this range.

No material reversals are present across score bands.

The alignment between the KS curve and the gains table indicates that the model achieves its strongest separation in the score ranges where defaults are most concentrated, supporting the conclusion that the model continues to rank-order risk appropriately.

MRO Assessment and Governance Considerations

From an MRO perspective, the 4Q2024 Somers’ D result reflects moderate discrimination, as stated by the model developer, and MRO concurs based on independent review of the gains table, KS curve, and rank-ordering diagnostics. The 2Q2025 results show improvement relative to 4Q2024, with stronger separation evidenced by higher Somers’ D and a KS statistic of 56 percent.

Taken together, these results indicate acceptable and improving rank ordering, and MRO does not view the observed performance pattern as a major issue.

However, MRO notes that 2Q2025 results are evaluated against updated performance thresholds, and that the developer has cited limitations of the original 2015 hBBT bad-rate environment as rationale for revising those thresholds. MRO notes that supporting quantitative analysis demonstrating how differences in bad-rate behavior or portfolio characteristics justify the revised thresholds was not provided in the OGM materials.

Accordingly, MRO raises a sub-issue requesting documented analytical support for the threshold revisions, including investigation of bad-rate distributions, score-level performance, and underlying portfolio characteristics across recent OGM periods, to ensure that threshold changes are appropriately supported and governed.

If you want, I can now convert this directly into final IVR language, extract just the SNOW sub-issue text, or shorten this further without losing governance clarity.

OGM Results Since Last Validation

Since the most recent validation, model performance has been monitored through the OGM process, with results reported for 4Q2024 and 2Q2025. During this period, both performance metrics and the applicable monitoring thresholds changed.

In 4Q2024, back-testing results showed a Somers’ D of 50.56 percent and an accuracy (MAD) of 1.15. Under the thresholds in effect at that time, both metrics breached the established performance criteria. Population stability remained satisfactory, with a PSI of 0.033, indicating that the score distribution was stable relative to the development baseline. The gains table for the evaluated vintage showed a generally monotonic pattern in observed bad rates across score bands, indicating preserved rank ordering despite the metric breaches.

Following 4Q2024, the model developer updated the OGM performance thresholds. The developer noted that the original thresholds were derived from a 2015 hBBT sample characterized by very limited bad rates and a risk environment that differs from more recent portfolio conditions. Based on this rationale, revised thresholds were implemented for subsequent OGM periods.

In 2Q2025, model performance was evaluated against the updated thresholds. Somers’ D increased to approximately 69 percent, representing an improvement relative to the 4Q2024 result. The KS statistic was reported at 56 percent, indicating meaningful separation between default and non-default populations. Population stability remained satisfactory, with PSI continuing to remain below the 0.10 threshold. The gains table showed no material bad-rate reversals across score bands, supporting continued acceptable rank ordering.

From an MRO perspective, OGM results since the last validation indicate stable population characteristics and improvement in discrimination metrics over time. While performance results in 2Q2025 fall within the updated threshold ranges, MRO notes that performance conclusions are dependent on the revised thresholds implemented after 4Q2024. Accordingly, MRO raised a sub-issue requesting documented analytical support for the threshold changes, including analysis of bad-rate behavior and score-level performance across recent OGM periods. Until such support is provided, the observed performance improvement is acknowledged, while governance around threshold revisions remains subject to follow-up.

If you want, I can:

* Shorten this to a **single IVR paragraph**, or
* Split it into **“Results” vs “MRO Assessment”** subsections to match a specific template, or
* Tighten the threshold discussion further to be maximally audit-defensive.
