Here’s a **clear, polite email draft** you can use. It’s concise and appropriate for an immigration/visa team.

Hi [Visa Team / Name],

I hope you are doing well. I filed my PERM application in September 2024 and wanted to ask whether you could please share the PERM case number with me for my records.

Thank you very much for your help, and please let me know if you need anything further from me.

Best regards,
Phoebe Chen
