Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in about the DFR LGD limited-scope validation.

I was originally supporting this as the secondary validator, but Rebecca has let me know she won’t be able to commit to this task. At the same time, I’m currently covering several full-scope validation, annual review, and a few limited-scopes, with a couple more tasks coming up soon.

I also didn’t participate in the initial full-scope validation of the RAC models, so there would be some ramp-up needed on the model background and prior validation context. Given that, I wanted to ask whether we could involve an additional resource, ideally someone who’s more familiar with the RAC models to help support this review.

Happy to talk through options or adjust as needed. Just wanted to flag this early.

Thanks,
Sophia
