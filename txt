This sub-issue has two parts related to 03_MEV_Selection.sas.

During our review of the GLGL model, we observed that pd_tob_cnt was selected as a loan-level variable and carried into the combined selection step, even though it does not impact MEV selection and was later removed due to collinearity.

We are also looking to confirm that the implemented selection logic and final selected MEVs in the code align with Section 4.4 and Table 4.2 (Final MEV Shortlist).
