I just wanted to say congrats again on the new AI role. It was kind of sudden news, but I’m really happy for you. It’s very well deserved.

Over the past few years, I’ve really appreciated the time and effort you’ve put into helping us grow. Especially pushing me to present on Python a few times — 
that actually helped me a lot.

I know you’ll still be around for another month, but I just wanted to say thank you for your support.

Also, if there’s ever an opportunity on your new team that might be a fit for me, I’d definitely be interested.

My PERM just got certified, and I’ve submitted a ticket to the visa team to initiate the I-140 filing.

I’m not sure yet what the internal approval flow looks like, but I wanted to keep you in the loop and check if you’d be comfortable supporting it. 

If anything is needed from your side once the visa team responds, I’d really appreciate your help.

I’m also happy to cover premium processing myself.
