Hi Paige,

Thank you for the update — I’m very glad to hear that my PERM has been certified.

I have two quick questions as we move to the I-140 stage:

1. Would it be possible to file the I-140 under **premium processing**? Given the current uncertainty and frequent changes in visa policy, I strongly prefer premium processing if feasible. If there are any funding constraints on the company side, I am more than willing to cover the premium processing fee myself.

2. I did not see the ETA Form 9089 attached to the email. Could you please resend it so I can review and sign the highlighted section as instructed?

Thank you very much for your help. Please let me know if anything further is needed from me.

Best regards,
Phoebe Chen
