Monitoring was not added (no separate metric + threshold), and instead assessed for reasonableness.

[MRO reviewed this assumption and confirmed that 63.8% of recoveries (count-based) occur within 8 quarters of default. 77.6% of recovery balances occur within 8 quarters of default.]

The question we raised was whether 8 quarters is appropriate for the recovery timing assumption.

Please confirm:

Whether this assumption will continue to be reviewed periodically.

Whether the supporting data and calculations for the 63.8% and 77.6% figures can be provided.

Recovery comparison (Sheffield example)

We asked for justification and monitoring of recovery similar to the Sheffield example:
Test = development numbers; Production = updated current numbers.

Please confirm whether this comparison was performed and share the supporting results.

c) Scaling factor (CCAR)

It is stated that this is already justified in the MDD:

“For CCAR, only the 9th quarter shows a consistent difference over the time periods, so the scaling factor is set to 1.98. The scaling factor is set to 1 for all other quarters. For CECL, differences are small, so the scaling factor is set to 1.”

However, the need for the scaling factor in the CCAR metric requires further explanation. Since the CCAR prediction is based on 9 quarters, the need for an adjustment to actuals using lifetime NCO losses is unclear.

Please clarify:

How the 1.98 was calculated (please share the numbers and calculation).

The data supporting the ratio of true actual lifetime NCO to truncated lifetime NCO at each quarter.

Please also share the data from Steps 1–5:

Collect actual historical values for each period from the model development data extraction process. The backtesting window aligns with that used for the performance metric thresholds (Section 9.1.2.1).

Compute the true quarterly actual lifetime NCO for each starting backtest date, including all observed history through June 2025.

Compute the truncated quarterly actual lifetime NCO for each starting backtest date, including only data through the backtest horizon (9 quarters for CCAR).

Calculate the ratio of true actual lifetime NCO to truncated lifetime NCO at each quarter.

Compute the Lifetime LGD Scaling Factor by averaging the ratios across periods.

d) Monitoring of retained variables (dpd_90_flag and STI_pre_merger)

These two variables were retained because they are statistically significant and help anchor the baseline effect.

MRO agrees they have high contribution to the model; however, less reliance on backward-looking variables is recommended.

Please confirm:

These two variables will be monitored in the PSA analysis.

They will be monitored in final model input form (including transformations of raw data) using PSI analysis, consistent with Section 6.2 of the MDD.
