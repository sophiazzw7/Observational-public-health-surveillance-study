If he says: “Tell me about yourself.”

I’ve been on the team about four years now. Before that, I worked on developing machine learning models in medical research. My background is in statistics.

Since joining here, I’ve mostly worked on ML-related validations and some of the more technical models. I’ve also led a few Python-related projects and helped run internal trainings for the team.

Simple. Clear. Done.

2️⃣ If he asks: “What are you currently working on?”

Right now I’m working on DFR, some Bankcard validations, and Operational Risk models. I also cover the LightStream ML PD model.

A lot of my time lately has been around remediation follow-ups and making sure documentation and testing are tight.

Stable. Responsible.

3️⃣ If he asks: “What do you enjoy working on?”

I enjoy the more technical models, especially machine learning ones. I like digging into the modeling logic and testing assumptions.

I also enjoy building tools in Python to make validation more efficient.

Shows depth without bragging.

4️⃣ If you want to lightly signal growth interest

Over time, I’d like to take on more complex or high-impact models, especially on the ML side. I’m happy to step up where needed.

Not aggressive. Just forward-looking.

5️⃣ If he asks about team involvement

I’ve helped with some Python trainings and shared code templates with the team. I enjoy that part — helping others get more comfortable with the technical side.

Signals leadership without saying “I’m a leader.”

6️⃣ If he asks: “How’s workload?”

Safe answer:

It’s been busy but manageable. A couple of full scopes at the same time, but things are progressing.

Never say overwhelmed in first meeting.

1️⃣ Opening Fillers

“Welcome to the team — glad to have you onboard.”

“Hope the first couple of days haven’t been too overwhelming.”

“I imagine it’s a busy transition week.”

2️⃣ Reaction to His EY Background

Neutral and professional (don’t overpraise):

“I saw you’re coming from EY — that’s great experience, especially on the governance side.”

“Your background at EY should be really helpful here, especially with process and controls.”

“I’m sure the advisory experience gives you a broad view across different model types.”

If he talks about consulting life:

“That must’ve given you exposure to a lot of different frameworks.”

“Sounds like a pretty fast-paced environment.”

Keep it curious, not flattery.

3️⃣ Light Engagement Questions

“What attracted you to move in-house?”

“What areas are you most focused on as you step into the role?”

“Anything in particular you’re hoping to understand early on?”

These shift focus to him — good move.

4️⃣ Small Conversational Fillers

If there’s a pause:

“Makes sense.”

“That’s helpful context.”

“Good to know.”

“That aligns with what we’ve been seeing.”

Short. Calm. Confident.

5️⃣ If He Talks Strategy

“That’s helpful direction.”

“I think the team will benefit from that.”

“Happy to align with that focus.”

6️⃣ Safe Closing

“Looking forward to working together.”

“Happy to be a resource as you get settled.”

“Appreciate you taking the time today.”
