Hi [Name/Team],

I hope you are doing well.

I checked my PERM case (G-100-24260-339547) and saw that it has been certified today. I wanted to kindly ask if the company could help initiate the I-140 filing as soon as possible.

If feasible, I would also like to request premium processing, and I am willing to cover the premium processing fee myself.

Please let me know the next steps and if there is any documentation or action required from my side to move this forward promptly.

Thank you very much for your help and support.

Best regards,
Phoebe Chen
