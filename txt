MRO noted that the 24Q2 and 24Q4 OGM reports referenced legacy EWI PSI thresholds of 0.11 and 0.27, whereas the current OGM thresholds are 0.10 and 0.25 following the end of the EWI period after 24Q2. This difference does not impact the color coding or performance conclusions, as all PSI values fall below both threshold definitions.
