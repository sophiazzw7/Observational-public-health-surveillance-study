Hi Adam,

Thank you for the detailed background and the proposed options.

For MIS0002017, since this involves the GLGL response (the model target), MRO would be comfortable with Option 1 provided the documentation clearly states that the recalculated response in the final GLGL creation script is the only version used in estimation and performance testing, and that the exploratory/EDA version never flows into the final model. We understand the two versions arose from parallel validation/development, but explicit traceability is important given this is the target variable.

Separately, for MIS0001218 – part CC (segment-level backtesting for the HBBT legacy indicator and Direct Auto indicator), Section 6.1.1.1 references additional backtesting and includes code to generate the figures; however, I’m not able to locate the rendered charts themselves in the MDD. Could you confirm where the final figures are included?

Thank you again.
