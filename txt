Perfect — below is the **revised two-section version (Stability + Back-Testing)** with your **new requirement explicitly incorporated**, keeping **MRO strictly in an assessment role**, and clearly distinguishing **what the developer stated** versus **what is missing** from a governance standpoint.

## Stability Assessment

Stability was assessed using the Population Stability Index (PSI) in accordance with the OGM plan.

For **4Q2024**, the reported PSI is **0.033**, which is below the inner threshold of **0.10**, indicating stable score distributions relative to the development baseline. The accompanying distribution plots show close alignment between the baseline and current score distributions.

For **2Q2025**, the PSI remains low at approximately **0.04**, continuing to fall below the **0.10** threshold. PSI results are consistent across reporting periods.

Based on these results, **population stability is assessed as satisfactory**, and changes in back-testing results are not attributable to population instability.

## Back-Testing Assessment

### Reported Results by Period

**4Q2024**

Back-testing results from **4Q2024** show:

* **Somers’ D:** **50.56%**
* **Accuracy (MAD):** **1.15**, exceeding the original accuracy threshold

The model developer states that a **Somers’ D of 50.56% represents moderate discrimination** rather than low discriminatory power. The developer further notes that the **original OGM thresholds were derived from a 2015 hBBT sample**, where observed bad rates were very limited and reflect a risk environment that differs materially from more recent periods.

**MRO agrees that the 4Q2024 Somers’ D level reflects moderate discrimination**, based on independent review of the accompanying diagnostics. The gains table for the **2023 vintage** shows a generally monotonic pattern in observed bad rates across score bands, indicating preserved rank ordering despite the metric breach under the original threshold framework. No material bad-rate reversals are observed.

However, while the developer cites differences between the 2015 hBBT environment and recent portfolio behavior, **no quantitative analysis is provided in the OGM materials to explicitly demonstrate how changes in bad-rate levels or portfolio composition justify the original threshold being no longer appropriate**.

---

**2Q2025 (Evaluated Against Updated Thresholds)**

For **2Q2025**, model performance is evaluated against **updated OGM thresholds established by the model developer**:

* **Somers’ D:** approximately **69%**
* **KS statistic:** **56%**
* Gains table: **no bad-rate reversals observed**

Relative to 4Q2024, discrimination metrics improve materially in 2Q2025.

### Joint Interpretation and KS / Gains Table Evidence

The **KS statistic measures the maximum separation between the cumulative default and non-default distributions**. Review of the **2Q2025 KS graph** shows that the **maximum separation occurs at approximately the 500 score level**.

This observation is consistent with the **2Q2025 gains table**, which shows that:

* The **majority of observed bads occur in the lower score range**, approximately **101–518**
* Bad rates decline as scores increase beyond this range
* No material bad-rate reversals are present across score bands

The alignment between the KS curve and the gains table indicates that the model achieves its **strongest separation in the score ranges where defaults are most concentrated**, supporting the conclusion that the model continues to rank-order risk appropriately.

---

### MRO Assessment and Governance Considerations

From an MRO perspective, the **4Q2024 Somers’ D result reflects moderate discrimination**, as stated by the model developer, and **MRO concurs** based on independent review of the gains table, KS curve, and rank-ordering diagnostics. The **2Q2025 results show improvement relative to 4Q2024**, with stronger separation evidenced by higher Somers’ D and a KS statistic of **56%**.

Taken together, these results indicate **acceptable and improving rank ordering**, and **MRO does not view the observed performance pattern as a major issue**.

However, MRO notes that **2Q2025 results are evaluated against updated performance thresholds**, and that the developer has cited limitations of the original 2015 hBBT bad-rate environment as rationale for revising those thresholds. **MRO notes that supporting quantitative analysis demonstrating how differences in bad-rate behavior or portfolio characteristics justify the revised thresholds was not provided in the OGM materials**.

Accordingly, **MRO raises a sub-issue requesting documented analytical support for the threshold revisions**, including investigation of **bad-rate distributions, score-level performance, and underlying portfolio characteristics across recent OGM periods**, to ensure that threshold changes are appropriately supported and governed.

If you want, I can now:

* Tighten the governance paragraph further to be **very audit-defensive**, or
* Extract the **sub-issue text exactly as it should appear in SNOW**, or
* Shorten this into a **single “Back-Testing & Stability” IVR subsection** without losing substance.
