Hi Adam,

We’re fine with items (1) and (2) as long as GLGL and Recovery component-level metrics are included in OGM. With those metrics in place, component-level review would naturally occur if Metric 1 breaches.

For the annual monitoring of loss timing and recovery timing assumptions, it would be fine to include this under the Other Monitoring Activities section.

Thanks,
Phoebe
