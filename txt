I just wanted to say congrats again on the new AI role. It was kind of sudden news, but I’m really happy for you. It’s very well deserved.

Over the past few years, I’ve really appreciated how much you’ve invested in training us. Especially pushing me to present on Python a few times — that actually helped me a lot.

I know you’ll still be around for another month, but I just wanted to say thank you for your support.

Also, since you’re moving into AI, if there’s ever an opportunity on your new team that might be a fit for me, I’d definitely be interested.

And separately — my PERM just got certified recently, and I’ve submitted the ticket to start the I-140 process. I just wanted to check if you’d be okay supporting it. I’m happy to cover premium processing myself.
