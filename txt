I just wanted to say congrats again on the new AI role. It was kind of sudden news, but I’m really happy for you. It’s very well deserved.

Over the past few years, I’ve really appreciated how much you’ve invested in training us. Especially pushing me to present on Python a few times — that actually helped me a lot.

I know you’ll still be around for another month, but I just wanted to say thank you for your support.

Also, since you’re moving into AI, if there’s ever an opportunity on your new team that might be a fit for me, I’d definitely be interested.

My PERM just got certified, and I’ve submitted a ticket to initiate the I-140 filing. I’m not sure what the internal approval flow looks like yet, but I just wanted to keep you in the loop and make sure there’s no concern from your side. I’m also happy to cover premium processing myself.
