Thanks for setting this up. I just wanted to make sure we’re aligned on coverage for the RAC limited-scope validation, especially since the primary validator isn’t able to commit and the work is about to start. I was listed as the secondary validator. Since the primary validator can’t commit, I wanted to flag that the setup has changed as we’re about to begin. I didn’t participate in the original full-scope RAC validation, so there’s some ramp-up needed on model context and prior decisions. Combined with current workload, I wanted to make sure we have appropriate coverage so the review stays on track. I’m happy to support the review, but I wanted to ask whether it would make sense to involve someone with prior RAC familiarity, or otherwise clarify how you’d like to handle coverage.
