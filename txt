Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up to clarify the due date for the sub-issue. While I originally indicated a 90-day timeline, Alex has approved an earlier due date of February 28, 2026.

I understand this is sooner than initially communicated, so please let me know if you have any questions or if there are any concerns I should be aware of.

Best,
Phoebe
