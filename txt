The AA model is used to generate adverse action reason codes for applicants scored by the ZORS credit risk models developed using the ZAML platform. It supports regulatory disclosure requirements by identifying and ranking the principal factors contributing to the difference between an applicant’s score and a defined reference population.


The model uses a Shapley value–based explainability approach implemented via TreeSHAP to quantify feature-level contributions relative to a reference population of approved borrowers and aggregate them into ranked adverse action reason codes.
