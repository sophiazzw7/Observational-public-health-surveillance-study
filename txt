Hi [Name],

Thank you again for approving the extension yesterday — I really appreciate it.

I just wanted to clarify one small detail. I noticed the extension was applied to the DFR task. Since Crystal and I have already made good progress on DFR, I was actually hoping to extend the RAC task instead, as that is where the additional time would be most helpful.

Would it be possible to adjust the extension to the RAC task instead?

Thank you again for your support — I truly appreciate it.

Best,
Phoebe
